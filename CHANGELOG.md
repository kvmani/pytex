# Changelog

All notable changes to PyTex are recorded here, newest first. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow the pre-1.0 semantics of
[API Stability And Deprecation](docs/standards/api_stability_and_deprecation.md)
(minor versions may break with deprecation warnings; patch versions do not).
Every release entry must state scientific behavior changes explicitly —
"fixed" for correctness, "changed" for convention or semantics — because
downstream analyses depend on them.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Orientation-relationship analysis flagship (development-guide Cycles A-B and
  follow-ons): index correspondence with rationalization and angular residuals
  (`correspondence_direct`/`correspondence_reciprocal`,
  `map_plane_to_child`/`map_direction_to_child` and inverses, across-variant
  tables); the misorientation representation (`misorientation()`) and
  deviation metric (`or_deviation`); parallelism finders
  (`find_parallel_planes`/`find_parallel_directions`); OR fitting
  (`fit_orientation_relationship`); variant packet classification
  (`variant_close_packed_groups`); variant pole figures
  (`variant_pole_figure`, `plot_variant_pole_figure`); named KS, GT, Pitsch,
  Burgers, and Shoji-Nishiyama constructors with standard catalogs; intervariant
  misorientation tables.
- Experimental map-scale parent-grain reconstruction
  (`pytex.experimental.reconstruct_parent_grains`, `..._from_graph`) with
  intervariant-fingerprint edge testing, union-find clustering,
  quaternion-averaged parent refinement, and EBSD grain-graph wiring.
- Explainable-results doctrine: `describe()` prose on every stable
  transformation report, substring-validated in tests.
- Transformation deformation gradients (`deformation_gradient()`,
  `DeformationGradientReport`): nearest-integer lattice correspondence, polar
  decomposition, textbook Bain stretches and the literature KS/NW rigid
  rotations pinned.
- Texture kernel breadth: `GaussianSO3Kernel` (Gauss-Weierstrass spectrum)
  and `AbelPoissonKernel` beside de la Vallee Poussin, with closed-form
  Chebyshev coefficients and halfwidth-defined construction;
  `KernelSpec.as_so3_kernel()` routes all three.
- Engineering: warnings-as-errors test policy with zero-warning suite;
  coverage ratchet (87%) and ubuntu+macos x Python 3.11-3.13 CI matrix;
  Hypothesis property suites (rotation algebra, Miller-Bravais round trips,
  correspondence invariants, hexagonal metrics); runnable transformation
  performance benchmark lane; `OrientationSet` slicing;
  `CrystalDirection.from_cartesian`; public `phases_semantically_match`.

### Fixed

- **Orientation-convention bug (scientific):** the transformation stack
  composed predicted children as `V @ P`, contradicting the normative
  crystal-to-specimen orientation convention; all prediction, deviation,
  fitting, scoring, and reconstruction surfaces now compose
  `g_child = g_parent o V^T`, pinned by a specimen-space parallelism
  regression test. Synthetic data was internally consistent either way; real
  measured orientations would have received wrong variant assignments.
- `SymmetrySpec` equality raised `ValueError` on distinct-but-equal instances
  and the class was unhashable; equality is now explicit semantic identity.
- Matplotlib figure leaks in the test suite; spglib's force-enabled
  dict-interface deprecation warning is intercepted at the adapter boundary.

### Changed

- `OrientationRelationship.parallel_directions` stores typed
  `CrystalDirection` pairs (index meaning preserved); the JSON contract emits
  typed payloads and still reads legacy float triples.

## [0.1.0.dev0]

Baseline development snapshot predating this changelog: canonical core model
(frames, symmetry, lattice, orientations, batches), texture (PF/IPF/ODF,
harmonics), EBSD (crystal maps, grains, KAM/GROD, CSL), diffraction (powder
XRD, SAED, scattering factors), plotting (pole figures, IPF maps, ODF
sections, VESTA-class crystal viewer, visualization primitives), adapters,
manifests, and the executable worked-example documentation system.
